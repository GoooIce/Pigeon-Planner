-= What is it? =-

Pigeon Planner aims to be a simple to use pigeon database.
Organise and manage your pigeons by adding, editing, removing
them in a list.
View their details, including, but not limited to, band number,
name, colour, picture, etc.
You can select to view the pedigree, relatives or results
per pigeon. Check a detailed pedigree with extra information
and a generation further or print the pedigree. See brothers
and sisters, halfbrothers and sisters and offspring.
View/add results for each one. With the detailed results window,
it is possible to see all results of all pigeons and sort them
according to some parameters.

Pigeon Planner can be started directly from the source directory
without installation.

which will start the application directly.
To install Pigeon Planner onto your system, run:
sudo python setup.py install

*Windows
Run the setup file and install the program. Start Pigeon Planner by
the shortcut in the startmenu or on the desktop (optional).
